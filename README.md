# Open Sidebar on Hover

This is a simple plugin that allows you to hover to both expand and collapse the sidebars!

## Features

Expand the left sidebar by hovering over the left ribbon, as such:

Then, to collapse it again, move your cursor out of the sidebar area!

If you'd like, you can even set a delay after you move your cursor out of the sidebar area!

Should you have a right ribbon, this should also function -- however, the setting is disabled by default, as Obsidian appears to no longer have a right ribbon.
